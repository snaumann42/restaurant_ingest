This project will ingest multiple restaurant data sources, clean up the data and remove duplicates. It will output a CSV containing all the restaurants, the count of duplicates and which file they originated from.

Since this is meant to be a production data pipeline, each ingest in our ingests folder will be considered a main/runnable ingest.
